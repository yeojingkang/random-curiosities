# Data Structures
The bread and butter of programming.

## Red-black tree
`rb-tree/`

I learned about this data structure in school, but never implemented it. Once I found out that Linux uses it everywhere in its kernel, I knew it's high time I wrote one to understand it better.

## C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
`stl/`

The STL contains a suite of versatile data structures and algorithms (and more), and what better way to understand their interface and inner workings than by implementing them myself? I wrote some of these containers during my undergrad days, but they were basic and only fulfilled a subset of the interface. This time I will attempt to implement the full interface as an exercise on template programming.
