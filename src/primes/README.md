# Prime numbers

Prime numbers are a topic of interest among mathematicians. They are natural numbers with only 2 factors: 1 and itself. It is such a simple property, but it is so unique that many  great minds have come up with numerous fascinating problems involving these numbers. More than just a theoretical curiosity, prime numbers have found their way into practical use in fields such as cryptography.

Here I made some programs involving prime numbers. They don't necessarily do anything meaningful. I just thought they seemed interesting.

## Prime numbers in irrational numbers

I came across an article that mentioned something about finding prime numbers in irrational numbers, and that piqued my interest. Irrational numbers go on indefinitely after all, so in theory we should be able to find an infinite number of prime numbers in them.

This program finds 15-digit primes in the first 10,000 digits of $e$.
